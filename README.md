# Stock-Price-Prediction
### **README - Stock Price Prediction with Real-Time Data**

---

#### **Project Overview**
This project is designed to automate the process of predicting stock prices using real-time data fetched from `yfinance`. The project uses machine learning models to analyze historical and up-to-date stock data, assisting in making informed trading decisions.

---

#### **Features**
- Fetches real-time stock data using the `yfinance` library.
- Automates daily data collection and storage in CSV format.
- Supports scheduling of stock data updates at specified intervals.
- Real-time predictions using machine learning models based on the latest data.

---

#### **Installation**

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock-price-prediction.git
   cd stock-price-prediction
   ```

2. **Install required Python libraries**:
   ```bash
   pip install yfinance pandas schedule scikit-learn
   ```

---

#### **Usage**

1. **Download and store stock data**:
   - By default, the script fetches real-time stock data for the ticker (e.g., "AAPL") and stores it in `store_stock_data.csv`.

   - Run the script manually:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Schedule the task**:
   - The script uses the `schedule` library to automate the process of updating stock data every day at 9:00 AM.
   - You can modify the time or interval in the script to suit your needs.

---

#### **How It Works**

1. The script fetches stock data from `yfinance` starting from a defined date up to the current day.
2. It saves the updated stock data to a CSV file, overwriting the existing data for consistency.
3. Predictions can be made using the machine learning model, which trains on the historical and real-time data.

---

#### **Customization**

- Change the stock ticker (e.g., AAPL) to another stock symbol in the `ticker` variable:
  ```python
  ticker = "GOOGL"  # For Google stock
  ```

- Modify the schedule to run at a different time by changing the `schedule.every().day.at("09:00")` line in the code.

---

#### **Future Enhancements**

- Integrate advanced machine learning models (e.g., LSTM for time-series forecasting).
- Add support for multiple stock tickers.
- Implement a more advanced dashboard for visualizing predictions in real time.
